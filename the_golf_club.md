# Single Length Irons

## David Lake, [1 Iron Golf](http://1irongolf.com/)

> We are led to believe that longer golf clubs produce greater
swing speeds on a linear scale and thus more distance. This is the
logic used in the concept of a 0.5” increase in length between irons
throughout a standard set of golf clubs. My testing showed that the
only static factor that results in the increased distance between irons
within a set is the difference in the loft angle of the clubheads. There
is absolutely no measurable difference in swing speed for a 0.5”
incremental shaft length increase. The only effect of the standard 0.5”
length increase between the irons and the fairway woods is to make
each successively longer club harder to hit.
