# Golf 1-2-3

This post is my contribution to the rapid simple golf learnings systems. I am aware of 3 systems that can make a significant 
improvement in your game within 1 hour or less time:
* [Positive Impact Golf](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eURbeXGkeCU) by Brian Sparks
* [Flow Motion Golf](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDXc826P1J4). This system was formerly known as Triangulaid. [Nicholas Middleton](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmxONfdzImc&t=228s) and [Stephane Bachoz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xN_7ji8Dbrk) continue this tradition from [Bill Owens](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUegLD70yWg).
