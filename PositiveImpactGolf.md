# Main Points *I* would focus on when giving lessons to a beginner

* The proper impact position of hands ahead of ball with a club shaft learning forward
* The way the arms work in the swing: one long, then the other. And the front arm in line with the shaft at all times.
* Rhythm
* Reflect

## What would you tell a beginner about ...

### His head

I would not say anything about this

### Their eyes
No comment except to reflect on the results of the swing when it is done

### Their arms

#### In the backswing
Left arm straight on the way back, right elbow bending initiates the backswing
