# Main Points *I* would focus on when giving lessons to a beginner

* The proper impact position of hands ahead of ball with a club shaft learning forward
* The way the arms work in the swing: one long, then the other. And the front arm in line with the shaft at all times.
* Rhythm
* Reflect

## What would you tell a beginner about ...

### His head

I would not say anything about this

### Their eyes
No comment except to reflect on the results of the swing when it is done

### Their arms

#### In the backswing
Left arm straight on the way back, right elbow bending initiates the backswing

#### Through and after impact
Elbow straightens. Hands are in front of the ball at impact.

### Their front foot
Nothing

### The line the club should take in the first foot of the backswing
Just follow the right elbow as it bends. The club will follow that.

### When should wrists cock in the backswing
No comment on this

### When should clubhead speed be the greatest
No comment, but downswing should be faster than backswing

### What should they do after a bad shot
Reflect and observe it.

### What should they do after a round of golf
No comment.
