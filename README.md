# The Golf Swing

> The ball is not on the ground. You are not hitting a ball that is on the ground. There's a ball on the end of your club and you're flicking it off.

David Lee, [Gravity Golf](https://gravitygolf.com/)

> You're making a pivot. If you watch this handle (of the golf club), it comes down and slows down while the club head speeds up. Then the handle speeds up again. That's a pivot. That's a lever.

> What we have here is a golf ball with a line at the equator. And I've put a dot on the 4th groove up from the bottom on this club head. The game of golf is connecting this dot with this line.

## Chipping

> The loft of the club gets the ball in the air. So chipping is just a bigger version of putting. Only now your putter instead of having a flat face has a lofted face.

## Pitching

> What happens to most people is they start to sway and everything is moving all over the place. This is nothing more than an arm swing and pivot. So if you just stand on your left foot and you use your right toe to balance you, not for weight, and now we are going to make swings.
