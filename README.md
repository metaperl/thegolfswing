# The Golf Swing

> The golf swing is just a baseball swing on a tilt

Wally Armstrong [Wally Armstrong Clinics in Action](https://youtu.be/JE-MskVJDl0?t=15m24s)

> The golf swing is made of two motions. One is rotating in a circle around the spine (no up and down, no forward and back) and the wrists cocking to 90 degrees in one direction and then the other.

> Focus fully on the clubhead and its weight - the path of that heavy circle carving through the air. And just try to pass it through the ball as precisely as you can.

> I don't worry too much about where my body parts are or what they are doing, because I'm focused fully on simply swinging the clubhead and striking the ball with the swinging clubhead.

> The ball is not on the ground. You are not hitting a ball that is on the ground. There's a ball on the end of your club and you're flicking it off.

David Lee, [Gravity Golf](https://gravitygolf.com/)

> You're making a pivot. If you watch this handle (of the golf club), it comes down and slows down while the club head speeds up. Then the handle speeds up again. That's a pivot. That's a lever.

> What we have here is a golf ball with a line at the equator. And I've put a dot on the 4th groove up from the bottom on this club head. The game of golf is connecting this dot with this line.

## Posture

> No up and down, no forward and back

> The swing is a circle with the spine as an axis

> Take a golf club down your back. As you bend over, stick your butt out.

## The Grip

> Do you notice as you lighten the grip pressure on the club, the club goes from feeling like a lead rod where you have no sensation of the end of the club to this very lightweight stick with a heavy head attached to it.

## The Backswing

> Does anyone have trouble getting too far to the inside? We do that when we start back by turning our shoulders. The swing should make the turn, not the turn make the swing.

> Sometimes I will put a towel underneath my arms and feel that my upper body is starting my swing.

Smyle Kaufman [One-on-One With Smylie Kaufman: Creating A Perfect Backswing](https://youtu.be/ctP_h5S4xgQ?t=46s)

> I like to feel that my upper body is pushing the club back rather than my body trying to start it. When I get to the top of the backswing, I want to feel I'm getting into my back right hip.

## Chipping

> weight is on front foot. ball is placed off back toe so the hands stay in front of the ball. Chipping is a pendulum motion. You want to imagine the club and the (front) arm form a straight line 

Wally Armstrong [How to Use the WallyMade Golf Power Hanger]()


> The loft of the club gets the ball in the air. So chipping is just a bigger version of putting. Only now your putter instead of having a flat face has a lofted face... here's what we are going to do: I'm going to roll the ball along the ground so I'm feeling what it feels like to have the shaft lean forward, catch the ball on the face and have it roll towards its target.

## Pitching

> All I need to do is position myself so that my arms can fall

Jim Flick [Jim Flick Lesson](https://youtu.be/_VTYq01XmV0?t=1m)

> What happens to most people is they start to sway and everything is moving all over the place. This is nothing more than an arm swing and pivot. So if you just stand on your left foot and you use your right toe to balance you, not for weight, and now we are going to make swings.
