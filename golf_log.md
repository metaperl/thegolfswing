# Golf Log

For some odd reason, when I was practicing today, I slowed down the backswing to a crawl, so that I could focus on the power move of golf ---
keeping the club in line with the forearm. It worked very well to create crisp contact.

I went home and discovered Ai Miyazato, a lady with a very very slow backswing and sometimes forward swing.

So now it appears that my swing is a combination of Wally Armstrong and Ai Miyazato.
